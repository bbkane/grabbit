# Grabbit

Grab subreddit images!! Heavily inspired by https://github.com/nagracks/reddit_get_top_images

# TODO

- homebrew integration (github actions?)
- user agent change (reddit API best practices)
- better image parsing (go/colly - see nagracks)
- `write-schedule --path [defaults to ...] --format [cron|systemctl|mac thingie]`
- rate limiting ( fetchbot? )
- better logging
